# Version 1.0
Finished Frame of Project, Can set exe variable, Choose memory adresses, ect. Not much in version 1.0. More coming soon.

# Version 1.1
Small bug fixes, added Viewing all values currently being used & Their Memory Addresses using raw pointers.

# Version 1.2
Added checks when changing memory, for example you could set a memory value without having a memory address. That was assessed, and now you can enter -> Help into the program to have it display in detail what each function does.

## Building From Source
